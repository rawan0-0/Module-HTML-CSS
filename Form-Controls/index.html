              What is git?
            </h2>
           <p> Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that plays a crucial role in modern software development. It allows developers to track changes in their codebase, collaborate effectively, and maintain a complete history of project development.   <br><br>

      <h2>
      Why do developers need Git?
      </h2>
    <p>
     Version Control: Git allows developers to track changes made to their codebase over time. This means they can easily compare different versions, identify when specific changes were made, and even revert to previous states if needed. This version control capability is crucial for maintaining code integrity and stability.

Collaboration: Git facilitates collaboration among developers and teams. Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Git's branching and merging features enable parallel development of features, bug fixes, and experiments while keeping the main codebase intact.

History and Audit Trail: Git maintains a detailed history of all commits and changes made to the codebase. This history serves as an audit trail, providing visibility into who made what changes and when. This information is invaluable for debugging, accountability, and tracking project progress.

    <h2>
      What is a branch in Git?
    </h2>

    <p>
     In Git, a branch is a separate line of development that allows you to work on a particular feature, bug fix, or experiment without affecting the main codebase. Branches are lightweight and serve as a way to isolate changes, making it easier to manage and collaborate on projects.
